This repository archives projects made by students of the MS Data Visualization program at Parsons School of Design.

> **Note**: Please submit a pull request with your new project URL if you relocate your work to a different domain name or hosting provider.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

You will need the following command line tools.

Required:

- **Node.js (v18.19.1)**
  [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm (v9.15.2)**
  [https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-npm)

Optional:

- A Node.js version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

## Development Tooling

### Astro

[TBD]

### TypeScript

[TBD]

### pnpm

This repository uses `pnpm` to run commands. pnpm is an alternative to `npm` but uses less storage space on your computer by installing local dependencies within a shared location.

Our `package.json` file defines some common scripts that are used during development. They can be invoked by running `pnpm [script name]`.

```sh
# Example:
# pnpm [script name]
pnpm dev
```

| script name | description                                                      | why is this helpful                                                                      |
| :---------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dev         | starts development server                                        | gives us a live preview of our site that we can view in the browser                      |
| build       | builds static deployment assets                                  | compiles framework specific files (like .vue) to browser compatible javascript           |
| preview     | previews the built site                                          | gives us a live preview of our site that we can view in the browser                      |
| format      | runs prettier to format files according to .pretterrc.yml config | keeps code style consistent and reduces the number of line changes between Pull Requests |
| lint        | runs eslint to check for code errors and bugs                    | helps catch errors like typos before we build the site                                   |
| test        | runs jest to execute unit tests to check components              | checks that recent changes don't change how our components function                      |

## GitHub Actions

This repository is set up to use GitHub Actions to check the status of commits made and to deploy the project to GitHub Pages. Each workflow is defined in a separate Yaml file in `.github/workflows/`. Check pnpm versions in each workflow if they fail to run successfully.

| workflow | description                                                                                                    |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| test     | runs formatter, linter, and ensures that build process do not throw any errors                                 |
| deploy   | builds web assets and pushes automatically to github pages branch                                              |

## Data

Project data is stored in `./src/data/projects/*.json`.

The projects array follows this template:

```json
{
   "description": "Project description",
   "image": "static/preview-YEAR/<STUDENT NAME>.png",
   "name": "Student Name",
   "portfolio": "<PORTFOLIO LINK>",
   "repo": "<PROJECT REPO>",
   "subtitle": "Project intro text",
   "tags": ["#data", "#technology"],
   "title": "Project title",
   "url": "<PROJECT LINK>",
   "video": "<VIDEO LINK>",
   "year": YYYY
}
```

## Local Development

### Starting a local development server

1. Make sure you have the right version of Node.js

   ```sh
   node --version
   # v18.19.1
   ```

2. Make sure you have the right version of pnpm

   ```sh
   pnpm --version
   # >= 9.15.2
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Start development server

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. You can now open <http://localhost:8080> in your browser.

## Deploying

An update to `gh-pages` is made when a commit is pushed to the `main` branch.

# How to contribute updates to this repository

It is recommended to follow the best practices detailed in the MS Data Visualization GitHub workflow document found at <https://github.com/visualizedata/github-workflow>

## Workflow for contributing to MS Data Visualization repositories

1. Initial setup:

   - [Fork a repository, create a local clone of your fork, and configure Git to sync your fork with the original repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

2. In the local clone of your fork, [create a branch for your edits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
   `git branch mybranch` creates a branch named _mybranch_
   `git checkout mybranch` switches to the branch _mybranch_

   - Do all your work in this branch.
   - [Push your branch](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/) to the forked repo early and often.
   - Never work in the `main` branch!
   - gh-pages will publish _directly to the live site_ (it takes about 5 minutes to update)

3. [Pull in changes often from the `upstream main` to keep it synced](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) so that when you prepare your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. Again, never work in the `main` branch!

4. [Merge the fork main into the fork branch](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16957483) and, if applicable, [resolve any merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/).
   `git merge <branch>` merges the specified branch into the current branch.

5. When you are ready for your contributions to be considered, open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) in GitHub. The Pull Request should be for the up-to-date **branch** of your fork. Prior to submitting the Pull Request, make sure you have:
   - Synced the fork main with the latest version of the upstream main (#3).
   - Merged the fork main to the fork branch and resolved any merge conflicts (#4).

## Tips

Use [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to log problems and communicate.

Sometimes, you mess up and need to go back to a previous commit. [Use `revert`](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/git-checkout). Do not use `reset`! Here's a helpful [Stack Overflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-to-revert-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit).
