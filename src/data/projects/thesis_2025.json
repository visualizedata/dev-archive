    "description": "Extreme weather—droughts, floods, fires, hurricanes—is now the norm, driven by greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Morocco, facing an unprecedented drought, is the focus of my thesis. What can be done now and in the future to prevent and mitigate climate disasters? While some solutions lie within Morocco, global action is crucial. I explore how to communicate climate realities and coping strategies to youth. Morocco’s case reflects a global challenge: countries must both endure the effects of climate change and work together to stop it.",

This project seeks to overcome these barriers through a combination of artificial intelligence and best practices in data aggregation and visualization. As a proof of concept, the project focuses on developing an interface for NYC Open Data’s 311 complaint dataset, aiming to demonstrate whether users can effectively derive insights from the data.",

While these drugs are safe when used alone, their active ingredients often overlap—leading to accidental overdose when taken together. Through the project, users can explore commonly used OTC products by symptom, check for overlapping ingredients, and learn about daily dosage limits. The project helps people understand how easily they might exceed safe amounts without realizing it. By simulating real-life choices, it raises awareness about the dangers of self-medicating with multiple products and encourages more careful, informed decisions about what we put into our bodies.",

    "description": "Sex education in the United States has long reflected the political and moral anxieties of the adults shaping it. Codified both culturally and legally, sex ed has tried to balance fear of sexual risk with an idealized vision of sex as foundational to family and society. Queer identities, often erased or stigmatized, have been a hidden force in that tension. Today, a resurgence of censorship laws target gender and sexuality in schools, even as new research underscores the stakes for queer youth. This thesis explores the entwined histories of sex education and LGBTQIA+ exclusion—and the potential of inclusive sex education to support youth wellbeing.",

In a city as diverse as New York, where food cultures from around the world exist block by block, the names and signs of grocery stores offer a clues about culture, community, and identity. This project explores the design elements of these signs, both textual and visual, to reflect on how the often-overlooked language of storefronts shapes how we navigate, experience, and connect with the city’s multicultural foodscape.",

Whether advocating for underserved communities or optimizing railway routes, users can explore how data-driven urban futures can reshape regional connectivity.\n\nWhat if you could find the best-fit route that maximizes services to the majority of the population while avoiding seasonal hurricanes?

    "description": "This project explores female characters in literary epics across time and culture, analyzing their traits to uncover recurring archetypes. What do cultures expect of women—and how much do those expectations differ across civilizations? By studying epics as repositories of collective values, this research investigates how idealized models of femininity are constructed. It asks whether these cultural ideals become internalized, shaping the inner voice through which women learn to govern themselves. Drawing from a diverse and global selection of epic texts, the project maps the persistence and evolution of feminine archetypes across mythology, religion, nationhood, and time.",

It analyzes transcribed speeches from the party’s official YouTube channel using artificial intelligence, word frequency analysis, and natural language processing (NLP). Additionally, it introduces a predictive AI model trained on thousands of far-right speeches and the Left Party’s election program to classify how closely a speech aligns with far-right discourse. The project reveals how language fosters political division and explores the potential of AI to identify early warning signs of right-wing radicalization.",

Examining over 10,000 YouTube comments alongside official Turkish government statements, this project visualizes how state narratives and propaganda shape public discourse. The interactive visualization reveals which government denial narratives are frequently echoed online, displaying both the scale and intensification of these statements. Machine learning classification identifies twelve distinct rhetorical stances, from explicit denial to minimization and justification. The comments form a searchable and downloadable archive—filterable by year, likes, and video source—transforming toxic content into a resource for studying genocide denial in digital spaces.",
