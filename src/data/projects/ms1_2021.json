    "description": "The National Museum of African American History and Culture\u2019s mission is \u201cto promote and highlight the contributions of African Americans\u201d. Its diverse array of artifacts come from a long history of both triumphs and injustices. If one were to analyze a collection of one object type (instruments, clothing, etc.) from this museum, could that collection alone tell a story of racial justice?During the 19th century, the abolitionist movement in America coincided with the advancements of photography technology. This resulted in recently-freed African Americans having easier access to cameras and gaining control of self-representation in a fight against racist stereotypes. African Americans could finally present and immortalize their best selves.This project explored the titles of the photography collection through an interactive word tree. Once users click to the end of a title structure, the corresponding photograph is revealed. This visualization offers a poetic approach to exploring the NMAAHC\u2019s photography collection that leads users to other thematic analyses of the collection. What can we learn from the juxtaposition of the Smithsonian\u2019s title structure versus the intention of the photo? How did the relationship between the photographer/photographed evolve? Is there further analysis to explore from the photos of the \u201cunidentified\u201d?",

    "description": "This project is a journey through the original watercolor and gouache design drawings by the legendary and prolific textile designer Suzie Zuzek (1920 - 2011). Between 1962 and 1985, Zuzek created over 1,500 designs for Key West Hand Print Fabrics in Key West, Florida, which were used by Lilly Pulitzer. Via the amazing collections from the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum. We aim to showcase the common motifs and style evolutions. To bridge between fabrics and fashion, we create an interface to both showcase the textile design as a full size wallpaper to create an immersive experience as well as creating hand-drawn fashion figures that give the audience a sense of how these fabrics feel like on the fashion design. To disentangle the effect ofSuzie Zuzek\u2019s fabrics on the fashion vs. the Lilly Pulitzer fashion style itself, we drew these fashion figures from scratch and varied the styles significantly from the original Lilly Pulitzer brand. We hope the study reveals the nature and scope of Zuzek's artistic contribution to the iconic Pulitzer style.",

In particular, I hoped to potentially highlight notable individuals or any disparities in the collection while also giving users the ability to view the gallery and portraits themselves. Drawing inspiration from the piece \u201cA Sort of Joy\u201d I added a layer of abstraction to my project by particularly focusing on the first names of the individuals in the collection and the number of times they may appear. In a future iteration of this project I hope to add gender identity as an element with which users can interact when they explore the gallery. ",

Buttons, posters, pamphlets, fliers, and more have been used throughout history to disseminate persuasive ideas and contribute to change in society. Different decades brought different popularity to the types of ephemera that were utilized. Were fliers popular during the 60s and 70s because of their ease of distribution? Were placards more prominent in recent years because of the global marches that flooded the streets during the black lives matter protests? A few prominent movements in history are represented in this Smithsonian dataset, and after clicking the arrow to reveal the second visualization we can see how each movement is represented by the ephemera that helped shape them.

In addition to being cited as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, other seminal developments took place outside the boxing ring. By crafting a dynamic biography of the boxer Muhammad Ali, this project weaves together different elements of his legacy to help the reader explore either horizontally or vertically the different facets of Muhammad Ali\u2019s life. In addition to textual content, images of symbolic objects displayed at the Smithsonian as well as iconic pictures help to enhance the storytelling experience. Finally, this project juxtaposes his record-breaking boxing accomplishments with the significant social and political developments that characterized his era, without forgetting to include noteworthy artistic creations that were influenced by performances as well as by his sense of social justice. This interactive project blends data-driven visual representations (derived from his boxing accomplishments) with more cultural elements such as posters, archival photos or symbolic artefacts, and allows readers to read more about the different chapters of his life (for example by examining more closely iconic images or by clicking on a given period of interest). Almost all images were obtained through the Smithsonian Open Access API, narratives and boxing data were obtained through literature review.",

White, red, and blue are the only colors, keeping the design language simple. Fonts used are Nasilization, a sans serif typeface based on the 1975 NASA Logo. As well as Courier New. Which has a fixed pitch design, monotone and slab serif in concept. Used to emulate typewriter output for reports, just like the old NASA reports. The goal is to highlight these objects individually and their history, as well as try to give the user a sense of time. The items are ordered in a timeline and I believe that gives the user a sense of the immense progress human flight and space exploration evolved in the 20th century",

    "description": "In this qualitative project: I wanted to Visualize the fly (Diptera) collection of the National Museum of National History Education and Outreach collection. I do that by using a flocking algorithm, but a random flocking behavior each time. With about 30 flies in total. The visualization contains an interesting variety of flies. An example of an implementation of Craig Reynold's Boids program to simulate flocking behavior. Each boid (flies in out case) steers itself based on rules of separation, alignment, and coherence.  The goal of the visualization is to inspire people of all ages to better understand the natural world and our place in it. By focusing on flies (Diptera), I hope to shed light on a species not often explored and looked at.",

    "description": "Design Movements is an interactive visualization of the digitized design objects in the Cooper Hewitt collection. It reinterprets different perspectives of the collection as a whole to provide 'bird's-eye' views of color, form, and place. In looking at color over time, form by frequency, and object origins spatially, users can explore the collection from a new view and draw their own conclusions about what design means to them, and where it may go in the future.",

    "description": "This project is an analysis of design materials used over time at the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian design museum. Inspired by the \u201cNature by Design: Plastics\u201d exhibition, this project explores natural and synthetic plastics. What is natural plastic? It is the material harvested via animals, such as: tortoiseshell, leather, and ivory. These materials were being over consumed and endangered many species of animals. To keep up with consumer demand, scientists developed a petroleum based, synthetic material. These materials include: polyester, nylon, and plastic. The use of these materials exploded and ultimately are contributing to our current climate crisis. THis project explored when and how these materials were being used.",
