    "description": "This is a project that seeks to understand how popular forms in clothing originated from humble beginnings and gained momentum over time. Machine learning was used to extract form from images at the MET's Costume Institute. Items were then clustered with kmeans, a statistical model that can be used to train machines to predict the items that are most similar from the information given. Kantar Information is Beautiful 2018 shortlist for People, Language & Identity.",
