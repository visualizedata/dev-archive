    "description": " Romance fiction, despite its immense popularity, is often dismissed, relegated to the periphery of literary discourse. This analysis unpacks its multifaceted appeal, exploring themes, structure, and reader psychology. It examines escapism, emotional fulfillment, and the genre's evolving representation to reflect diverse audiences. By analyzing the interplay between romance fiction and social forces like gender roles and technology, this work dismantles stereotypes and argues for its rightful place in literary discourse.",

    "description": "The history of Los Angeles is defined by the need to tame the flow of water and nothing epitomizes this more than the Los Angeles Aqueduct and Los Angeles River. Completed in 1913, the aqueduct is both an incredible feat of engineering and an artifact of theft, corruption, and exploitation. To this day, it conveys a third of LA’s water from over 200 miles away, ecologically draining Owens Valley in the process. Meanwhile, the perception of the Los Angeles River as a concrete eyesore conceals the many layers of ecological and cultural significance it contains. This thesis explores both the history and potential future of water in Los Angeles.",

    "description": "Navigating New York City after dark presents a challenge, especially for the city's vibrant youth who revel in its nightlife. As nightlife hotspots and affordable residential areas diverge from the city center, relying on central public transit like the subway becomes impractical. Nighttime taxi rides emerge as the primary alternative for post-party journeys. This thesis proposes a navigational board to analyze night taxi ridership, mapping routes from nightlife clusters to young residential areas. By assessing demand, cost, and time, this tool aids the NYC Office of Nightlife in prioritizing transit improvements. It empowers the younger generation to navigate nocturnal limitations, easing nighttime mobility struggles in the city.",

Deeply ingrained vegetarian traditions and an abundance of naturally vegan dishes make it a prime example for exploring a plant-based future. This project examines India's rich culinary heritage, focusing on vegan dishes and exploring easy substitutions. By delving into this intersection of culture, sustainability, and dietary choices, we gain valuable insights that can inform the global shift towards plant-based living.",

    "description": "The premise of my project is centered around investigating an increasingly controversial topic in the sporting community. The term, sportswashing has become commonly used by the media to describe sporting events hosted or sponsored by nations, corporations & individuals who seek a positive improvement in public reputation. As a football enthusiast, I decided to use the 'beautiful game' as a case study into investigating this issue. Analyzing major football events since 1930, we review the controversial ones to discover if there is a process to this act. My project covers the evolution of this act, a history of involved parties and their corresponding financial investment, news headlines highlighting the media outrage and acts by involved parties in relation to this topic.",
